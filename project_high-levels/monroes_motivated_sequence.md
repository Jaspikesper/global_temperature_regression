## Monroe's Motivated Sequence: Climate Change Argument

### 1. Attention
**Climate change is happening. Fighting climate change is urgent.**

### 2. Need
**While temperatures have risen and fallen slightly in the past, more recent data shows an accelerating increase. These hotter temperatures cause disasters, including wildfires and coastal flooding. **

### 3. Satisfaction
**Examine and seek to explain data through empirical risk minimization study. The task is not simply find the closest curve but the one that: 1: accurately explains past data and 2: makes accurate predictions.**

### 4. Visualization
**Display interactive regression plotting project, allow audience members to express their own predictions.**

### 5. Action
**Understand that climate change is a long term issue, that is exponential in nature. Don't be afraid to call out climate denial. Fight falsehoods with facts, not hatred or arrogance. Back the science and secure funding for climate research even when politics makes it harder. Use your role in society to fight emissions. **
