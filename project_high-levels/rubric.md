# Earth Day winner \$300 Club Fund Prize

## Criteria

The display must be the original work of the students of the club, demonstrate a clear message or raise awareness about the state of our environment, and reflect creative expression of the Earth Day theme.

My vote goes to The Pride Club. The students at the table were very welcoming. They Encouraged me to make a little potted seedling and explained about the purpose of their club. They talked about the importance of keeping our planet clean and GREEN. Their members were engaged in the activity and it was nice watching them encourage other students to participate. They also had a gender sticker basket of cute stickers to share with others. The Advisor for the club was also close by, encouraging but letting the students lead the show. Five STARS!!!
